    <h2>Foreword</h2>

    <p>The feeling of pride, sense of belonging and creativity have been trademarks of Regent Park for
    decades. In the year 2040, post-revitalization, even though there is a cultural and social
    divide,
    this community that fears that they’ll never reconnect, has the potential to bounce back.
    “Little
    characteristics that I remembered are now blurs, and it’s kind of sad because those were the
    pieces
    we grew up with.” - Stacy Regent Park is a community that wants to stay connected to the people
    who
    have always been their neighbors - the ones they grew up with, the ones they lost touch with and
    the
    ones they’ll welcome to the place they call home. “Where are all these memories going? Whose
    community is it now?” - Jael It is important to keep this in mind when thinking about the future
    of
    neighbourhoods and how human-centred design can leverage the strengths of a community to improve
    the
    lives of those who live there. With the challenge of transforming Regent Park into an Ethical
    Smart
    City by the year 2040, characteristics of the neighbourhood can be utilized in design solutions
    to
    recreate history and foster an increase in social capital for all. A treasured piece of
    long-time
    residents’ history is their beloved green boxes. To many, a green box is simply the metal
    container
    that houses hydro machinery, but to those who grew up in Regent Park pre-revitalization, the
    green
    boxes were a hang-out spot, a landmark they’d gather around to connect with friends. “All over
    Regent, there was green boxes. They were everywhere and they were always the hangout spot.” -
    Limees
    Taking inspiration from the original community’s rituals, Regent Park can rescue their history
    and
    create new memories as well as share the products of their creativity. To recreate feelings of
    the
    past, with a modern twist, Regent Park will gain an outdoor public hub in the centre of the
    neighbourhood, including a permanent installation shaped like the old green boxes, where members
    of
    the 2040 community can casually gather and create unbreakable bonds that once were the strength
    of
    Regent Park. Just as many other ancient monuments the green box will commemorate and preserve
    the
    memories of the elders, be a symbol of the spirit of the young ones and a tribute to the soul of
    the
    community. This design report will outline a human-centred design strategy to reimagine
    Toronto’s
    Regent Park as an Ethical Smart City by the year 2040. With a focus on ethical values and
    significant research to reinforce design decisions, this project will be brought to light to
    emphasize the recreation of the essence of historically significant spaces of Regent Park before
    the
    revitalization began.</p>
    <h3>Design Question</h3>
    <p>How might we create a place where Regent Park residents can gather and connect, regardless of
    their
    background?</p>
    <h3>Audience of the Ethical Smart Solution</h3>
    <p>People who live in Regent Park in 2040.</p>
    <h3>Goals</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>To build social capital and sense of community.</li>
    <li>To rescue the history of Regent Park and create new memories.</li>
    <li>To exhibit and incentivize creativity in the community.</li>
    <li>To include Ethical Values in a human-centred design for 2040.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research Summary</h2>
    <img src="/img/regent-park-2.jpg" alt="Image of Regent Park">
    <h3>History and Trends of Regent Park</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>60% of the original Regent Park population pre-revitalization was born outside of Canada
    </li>
    <li>Pre-revitalization, residents gathered no matter their background or differences</li>
    <li>There are 70 different languages spoken in Regent Park</li>
    <li>70% of residents are living with low income</li>
    <li>The current segregated housing complexes separating those in social housing from those in
    condos does not improve lives but instead increases negative social outcomes </li>
    <li>People who live in social housing feel more attached to their history, meaning they are the
    most affected by the revitalization</li>
    <li>Forced relocation can be traumatic and detrimental to people’s health, as they are torn from
    their support system</li>
    <li>Youth who lived in Regent Park pre-revitalization feel “disembodied” from Regent Park as
    they witness their history being demolished</li>
    <li>Those returning to Regent Park as the revitalization is ongoing feel increasingly socially
    isolated as they have lost touch with friends and the physical space</li>
    <li>There have been efforts to bring the community together, through the Community Animator
    Program and Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment partnerships, but the effects of those have
    not rippled through the neighbourhood</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Future Trends of Public Spaces in Toronto</h3>
    <li>Multi-purpose spaces</li>
    <li>Increase in sensor infrastructure to collect data</li>
    <li>Increase in social networks within public spaces</li>
    <li>Challenges include data governance and intellectual property in spaces</li>
    <h3>Significant General Trends of the Future</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Increased digital connectivity paired with an increase in isolation and loneliness</li>
    <li>The current statistic of 34.6% of Canadians who do not feel a sense of belonging to their
    local
    community is at risk of increasing</li>
    <li>Inclusive design will become mainstream</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <li>Reintegration of the community</li>
    <li>Preservation of history</li>
    <li>Social stratification</li>
    <li>Isolation</li>
    <h3>Major Insights</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Humans need more than just being placed in the same geographic location to bond.</li>
    <li>Art brings people together to foster authentic interactions, shared experiences and,
    ultimately,
    social capital/ inclusivity.</li>
    <li>The strengths of a community, especially creative ones, can be a great starting point for
    smart
    solutions.</li>
    <li>Changes may not always seem beneficial at first, but they do bring new opportunities.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Residents create art, music and stories to be curated by the Arts and Cultural Centre, then
    showcased
    on and inside The Box.</p>
    <p>The Box is a cube-shaped, permanent installation in a central location of Regent Park - the
    Community
    Park. An ode to the historically significant green boxes, The Box will be a community hub - a
    place
    to connect people to one another through storytelling of new and old history, a showcase of
    visual
    art and music as well as a place to interact organically with neighbours. In partnership with
    the
    neighbourhood’s Arts and Cultural Centre, Daniel’s Spectrum, art and stories by residents will
    be
    created and curated to be exhibited on and inside The Box and an archive of all art will be
    stored
    at the Centre. </p>
    <p>The Box’s sense of place and social interchange, much like the feeling of gathering around a
    campfire, is enhanced by inclusive and accessible design that incorporates a mixture of urban
    seating that promotes conversation and connection in a public space open to all.</p>
    <p>Technology is used to streamline processes of The Box. Display screens on the inside and outside
    of
    the structure are ultrathin, Smart Tiles, which have temperature sensors, keep the area warm in
    the
    colder months, voice control to interact with The Box inside, free wifi connection at 10G speeds
    and
    renewable, solar energy to power itself sustainably.</p>
    <p>Every first Sunday of each month, the showcase will change to allow for inclusion of new artists’
    work and bring residents or other Torontonians to the area to share in building social capital
    and
    history.</p>
    <p>The Box will serve as a monument for the past as well as the future of Regent Park’s ability to
    come
    together to own a shared sense of belonging.</p>
